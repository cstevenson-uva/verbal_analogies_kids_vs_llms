Description variables
--------------------

1. Item number
- Description: Unique number given to verbal analogy problem.
- Unit of Measurement: Numeric identifier	

2. type_verband
- Description: The relationship between the A and B term and the C and D term of verbal analogy problems used in the adaptive learning system Prowise.
- Unit of Measurement: Categorical (Nominal)
- Categories: actie-resultaat, classificatie, deel-geheel, delen van een eigenschap, dezelfde categorie, gebrek aan, hoort bij elkaar, gebrek aan, item-eigenschap, object-functie, object-locatie, oorzaak-gevolg, probleem-oplossing, uitvoerder-actie, teken van, tegengestelden, synoniem	

3. A
- Description: The first term in a verbal analogy of the form "A is to B as C is to D". Represents the base of first word-pair of the analogy. 	
- Unit of Measurement: None 

4. B
- Description: he second term in a verbal analogy, representing the concept to which "A" is related. It is used for retrieving relationships and similarities between the analogy elements in the base domain.
- Unit of Measurement: None

5. C
- Description: The third term in a verbal analogy, serving as a base for the second pair of related terms. It is used to draw a relationship with the A and B pair.	
- Unit of Measurement: None 	

6. D
- Description: The fourth term in a verbal analogy, representing the concept or item to which "C" is related. The D-term determined by mapping the mostly likely relationship between A and B, to the target domain, C, to come up with D. It is the correct answer on the verbal analogy problem,	
- Unit of Measurement: None  	

7. Ans1
- Description: The first alternative answer option for the D-term in a verbal analogy problem, which is an incorrect match for the given A, B, and C terms.	
- Unit of Measurement: None	

8. Ans2
- Description: The second alternative answer option for the D-term in a verbal analogy problem, which is an incorrect match for the given A, B, and C terms.	
- Unit of Measurement: None  	

9. Ans3
- Description: The third alternative answer option for the D-term in a verbal analogy problem, which is an incorrect match for the given A, B, and C terms.
- Unit of Measurement: None  	

10. Ans4
- Description: The fourth alternative answer option for the D-term in a verbal analogy problem, which is an incorrect match for the given A, B, and C terms.	
- Unit of Measurement: None 

11. semantic_distance_near_far
- Description: Conceptual Distance Between Base and Target Domains. The greater the distance between an analogy base and target domain the more difficult the analogy is for adults and children to solve. It is measured by determining the cosine distance between the A:B and the C:D pair. The distances are categorized as near (distance ranging from 0-.35), middle (.36-.64) or far distance (.65-1.0). 
- Unit of Measurement: Categorical (Nominal)
- Categories: near, middle, far	

12. distractor_salience_high_low
- Description: The relation between C:D relative to each of the C:D’, where D’ represents each distractor option. Distractor salience is high, when the semantic similarity between C and one of the incorrect answers D’ is greater than the semantic similarity between C and the correct answer D. 
- Unit of Measurement: Categorical (Nominal)
- Categories: high, low

13. type_relation_jones
- Description: The relationship between the A and B term and the C and D term of verbal analogy problems, according to Jones (2022) 
- Unit of Measurement: Categorical (Nominal)
- Categories: categorical, compositional, causal
